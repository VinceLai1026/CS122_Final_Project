## Project Description
This project will create a Python interface that allows users to explore real-time weather data. It will gather weather data from the internet, store it, analyze it, and visualize trends. The interface will have buttons, drop-downs, and multiple screens. The project aims to make weather analysis easy and insightful. It will be built using Tkinter or Flask.

## Project Outline/Plan
- Set up GitHub and assign roles
- Build GUI (Tkinter or Flask)
- Fetch data from web
- Store and clean the data
- Analyze trends
- Visualize results
- Present final product

## Interface Plan
We will build a 2-screen GUI using Tkinter with at least 4 widgets: a drop-down to choose city, a button to fetch data, a checkbox for selecting temperature or humidity, and a graph output.

## Data Collection and Storage Plan (written by Vince Lai)
I will use a weather API or scrape data from a free weather site. The data will be stored in CSV files organized by city and date.

## Data Analysis and Visualization Plan (written by [Het Tikawala])
I will use NumPy and Matplotlib to calculate averages, detect anomalies, and plot graphs showing temperature changes over time.
